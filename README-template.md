## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to use flex property well in this simple challenge.

Box-sizing includes the padding and border of the overall size of an element.

```html

```
```css

body{
  height: 100vh;
}

```
```js

```


### Continued development

I want to learn more about flexbox and grid property.

### Useful resources

- Google Fonts
